# GulpBuild
A simple gulp build with just the necessities

These builds are often too complicated so this build tries to address minimum but important project requirements: <br/>

1) Script minification and concatenation. <br/>
2) Script error checking using js Hint. <br/>
3) SASS transformation to CSS and minification. <br/>
4) Hot rebuild and reloading onchange. <br/>
5) Automated testing also possible.
