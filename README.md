# GulpBuild
A simple gulp build with just the necessities

These builds are often too complicated so this build tries to address minimum but important project requirements:

1) Script minification and concatenation.
2) Script error checking using js Hint.
3) SASS transformation to CSS and minification.
4) Hot rebuild and reloading onchange.
5) Automated testing also possible.
