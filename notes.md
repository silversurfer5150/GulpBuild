##Session 09: Github basics and A Simple Gulp Build

1. Github overview (basics and intermediate) (Vlad)
2. A Simple Gulp Build (Will)

To test out this build just following these simple steps:

1. Make sure you have node.js installed
2. Open command line as Administrator
3. Make sure you have Gulp installed globally otherwise the next step won't work - "do npm install gulp -g"
4. Next, type "npm install" - the necessary folder structure will be created
5. Type "gulp" - the build will run and launch the demo page in your default browser

You can then edit any of the js, sass files in the src folder and your changes will immediately be synced to the browser. Also any changes you make to the html will trigger an instant page load.
